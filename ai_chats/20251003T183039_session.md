> 
> 2. **Move files into the directory**:
>    ```bash
>    mv your-generated-files \package\exercise1\ui2
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Verify the directory structure**:
>    ```bash
>    ls \package\exercise1\ui2
>    ```

#### _User_

> what is your current working directory?

#### _Assistant_

> Your current working directory is: `C:\data\job\BAM\tech_exercise_v.0.0.4`

#### _User_

> using the Angular CLI initialize a new Angular application using typescript

#### _User_

> change the current working directory to package\exercise1\ui2

#### _Assistant_

> Changing the current working directory to `package\exercise1\ui2`...

#### _Assistant_

> The command failed because the Angular CLI (`ng`) is not recognized in the current working directory. Let's fix this by ensuring the Angular CLI is installed and the command is properly executed.
> 
> ### Steps to Resolve:
> 
> 1. **Install Angular CLI** (if not already installed):
>    ```bash
>    npm install -g @angular/cli
>    ```
> 
> 2. **Verify Angular CLI Installation**:
>    ```bash
>    ng --version
>    ```
> 
> 3. **Initialize a New Angular Project**:
>    ```bash
>    ng new acts-ui --routing=router --directory=package\exercise1\ui2 --skip-git
>    ```
> 
> 4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
>    ```bash
>    cd acts-ui
>    ```
> 
> 5. **Verify the Project Structure**:
>    ```bash
>    ls
>    ```
> 
> Let me know if you'd like to proceed with initializing the project or need further assistance!
